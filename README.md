# Emotions Data Analysis

This repository hosts a Jupyter Notebook dedicated to analyzing emotions expressed in tweets. The project leverages a dataset of English Twitter messages, each labeled with one of six emotions: anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, and surprise, to explore and visualize the emotional undertones of social media interactions.

## Project Objectives

- To classify tweets by emotion using data science techniques.
- To analyze and visualize the distribution of emotions.
- To explore linguistic patterns associated with different emotions.

## Dataset
